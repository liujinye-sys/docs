\[ English | [简体中文](../../zh-cn/demo/Smart_Band_Example_zh-cn.md) \]

## Introduction

Bandx is a smart band demo that incorporates watch dial, launcher, music, heart rate, stopwatch, sleep, sports, settings and flashlight, with a resolution of 194 x 368 pixels.Details about bandx are available in the “apps/packages/demos/bandx/” directory.

This article describes how to run this example on openvela Emulator.

## Prerequisites

1. Set up the development environment. Refer to [Environment Setup](./../quickstart/Set_up_the_development_environment.md).

2. Download the source code. Refer to [Download openvela source code](./../quickstart/Download_Vela_sources.md).

## Step 1: Configure the project

1. Switch to the root directory of openvela repository and execute the following command to configure Bandx.

   > The emulator configuration file (defconfig) is in the “vendor/openvela/boards/vela/configs/goldfish-armeabi-v7a-ap/” directory, and the emulator code is configured and compiled using “build.sh”.

    ```Bash
    ./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/vela/configs/goldfish-armeabi-v7a-ap menuconfig
    ```

   - build.sh: A script for compilation used to configure and compile openvela code.
   - vendor/openvela/boards/vela/configs/goldfish-armeabi-v7a-ap: configuration path
   - menuconfig: Open the menuconfig page to modify the configuration of the project code.

   The following screen appears after execution:

2. Press the “/” key to search and modify the following configurations:

   ```Bash
   LV_USE_FRAGMENT = y
   LVX_USE_DEMO_BANDX = y
   BANDX_BASE_PATH = "/data"
   ```

   > Take LV_USE_FRAGMENT as an example for illustration. The other configurations are modified is the same way.

    1. Enter the configuration to be searched.

   4. Press the “/” key to continue searching for the remaining configurations, and modify them as described above.

   5. Press the letter Q to bring up the exit Save screen as follows.

   6. Press the letter Y to save the configuration and exit the Modify Configuration page.

## Step 2: Compile the project

1. Switch to the root directory of openvela repository and execute the following commands one by one in a terminal:

    ```Bash
    # Clean up build artifacts
    ./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/vela/configs/goldfish-armeabi-v7a-ap distclean -j$(nproc)

   #Start to build
   ./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/vela/configs/goldfish-armeabi-v7a-ap -j$(nproc)
   ```

2. After successful execution, you will get the following files:

    ```Bash
    ./nuttx
    ├── vela_ap.elf
    ├── vela_ap.bin
    ```

## Step 3: Launch the emulator and push resources

The font and image resources used in Bandx are located in ‘apps/packages/demos/bandx/resources/’. To push these resources to the corresponding file paths mounted by the emulator, follow the steps below.

1. Switch to the root directory of openvela repository and start the emulator:

    ```bash
    ./emulator.sh vela
    ```

2. Push resources to the device by using emulator-supported ADB. Open a new terminal in the root directory of openvela repository, type “adb push” followed by the file path to transfer the resources to the appropriate location.

    ```bash
    # Install adb
    sudo apt install android-tools-adb

    # Push resources
    adb push apps/packages/demos/bandx/resource/font/assets/* /data/font/
    adb push apps/packages/demos/bandx/resource/image/assets /data/image/
    ```

   > If “BANDX_BASE_PATH” is changed to a non-default value like “/tmp”, the resource files must also be moved to the “/tmp/font/” and “/tmp/image/” directories.Otherwise, a “resource not found” error will occur.

## Step 4: Start Bandx

1. Enter the following command in the emulator's terminal environment “openvela-ap”:

   ```Bash
   bandx &
   ```

   > Note: The music page is just a UI display, with no access to audio.
